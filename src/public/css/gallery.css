/** When you have long content, a scrollbar appears by default on most desktop browsers .
    But when you trigger a modal view in page, it triggers the scroll bar to disappear.
    This is caused by this code in bootstrap   .modal-open {overflow: hidden; }
    It's an annoying effect because the background page starts moving when the modal moves in / disappears.
     To override this annoying effect, i use the following code
  **/
.modal-open {
  overflow: scroll !important;
}
